# Face-Card-Game

The game is played by flipping over cards, either from face-down to face-up or from face-up to face-down. As you play, you are told your total score (ie, total of the face-up cards) and the total score of the cards that are face down. The challenge is that you only get up to a fixed number of flips and then the game is over.
